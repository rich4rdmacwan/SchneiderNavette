It is aimed to aid the user to explore a geographical region virtually, plan routes and journeys, \"Find\" places of interest and much more.\r\n\r\n### Why the name SchneiderNavette?\r\n_Ville du Creusot_ was a hub of iron ore mines and forges which were bought by [Adolphe Schneider](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adolphe_Schneider) and his brother [Eug√®ne Schneider](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eug%C3%A8ne_Schneider) in 1836. They developed a business in steel, railways, armaments, and shipbuilding. The name is a tribute to the excellent work done by them.\r\n\"Navette\" is the french word for shuttle. The project signifies the idea of exploring the city in a shuttle.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nIgor Peric(codeteam17), Dina Youakim(dyouakim), Richard Macwan (rich4rdmacwan)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
